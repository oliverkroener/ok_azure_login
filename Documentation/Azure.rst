=======================================================
Configuration of Microsoft Entra ID (formerly Azure AD)
=======================================================

This guide walks you through registering an application in Microsoft Entra ID
so the extension can authenticate users via the OAuth 2.0 authorization code
flow.

..  attention::
    The **Client ID** can be found on the overview page in Azure and **should not be confused with the Client Secret ID**. For the secret configuration, only the Secret **Value** itself is required, not the Secret ID.

..  note::
    This guide assumes you have **administrative access to Microsoft Entra ID** and the necessary permissions to register applications.

1.  Register an application in Microsoft Entra ID

    Go to `https://portal.azure.com <https://portal.azure.com>`__ and navigate
    to :guilabel:`Microsoft Entra ID` > :guilabel:`App registrations`.

2.  Configure the application

    - **Name**: Choose a descriptive name (e.g. "TYPO3 Azure Login").
    - **Supported account types**: Select "Accounts in this organizational directory only (Single tenant)".

3.  Add redirect URIs

    Under :guilabel:`Redirect URI`, select **Web** and add the callback URLs
    that match your TYPO3 site:

    - Frontend: ``https://your-domain.com/your-login-page`` (the page containing the Azure Login content element)
    - Backend: ``https://your-domain.com/typo3/azure-login/callback``

    ..  tip::
        You can add multiple redirect URIs later in the :guilabel:`Authentication`
        section of the app registration. The frontend redirect URI should point
        to the page where Microsoft redirects the user after authentication.

        The backend redirect URI is automatically generated by the extension
        from its route configuration. You can find and copy it in the backend
        configuration module (:guilabel:`Web` > :guilabel:`Azure Login` >
        Backend config). It always uses the path ``/typo3/azure-login/callback``.

        If you run a multi-site setup with different domains, add redirect URIs
        for each domain.

    Click :guilabel:`Register`.

4.  Collect Tenant ID and Client ID

    On the :guilabel:`Overview` page, note down:

    - **Directory (tenant) ID** -- this is the ``Tenant ID``
    - **Application (client) ID** -- this is the ``Client ID``

    ..  attention::
        The **Client ID** is the Application ID on the overview page. Do **not**
        confuse it with the **Secret ID** shown in the next step.

5.  Create a client secret

    - Navigate to :guilabel:`Certificates & secrets` > :guilabel:`Client secrets`
    - Click :guilabel:`New client secret`
    - Enter a description and choose an expiration period
    - Click :guilabel:`Add`

    ..  attention::
        - Copy the **Secret Value** immediately after creation -- it will not be shown again.
        - Manage the expiration and renew the secret before it expires to maintain uninterrupted service.
        - The **Secret Value** is sensitive information. Store it securely and do not expose it in public repositories or logs.

6.  Configure API permissions

    The extension uses the **authorization code flow** with **delegated permissions** (not application permissions). It requests the following scopes:

    - ``openid`` -- sign-in
    - ``profile`` -- basic user profile
    - ``User.Read`` -- read the signed-in user's profile (email, display name)

    To configure:

    - Navigate to :guilabel:`API permissions`
    - Click :guilabel:`Add a permission` > :guilabel:`Microsoft Graph` > :guilabel:`Delegated permissions`
    - Select: ``openid``, ``profile``, ``User.Read``
    - Click :guilabel:`Add permissions`
    - Click :guilabel:`Grant admin consent for [Your Organization]`

    ..  note::
        Unlike server-to-server integrations, this extension authenticates on
        behalf of the user. Only **delegated** permissions are needed --
        **application** permissions are not required.

7.  Configure in TYPO3

    Enter the collected credentials (Tenant ID, Client ID, Client Secret, frontend
    redirect URI) in the TYPO3 backend module at :guilabel:`Web` > :guilabel:`Azure Login`.
    The backend redirect URI is shown as a read-only field with a copy button.

    See :ref:`Configuration <configuration>` for details.
